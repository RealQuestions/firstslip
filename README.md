Welcome to the RealQuestions codebase


'FirstSlip' Code base. Excited to release this, looking forward to hearing from everyone.  These intial releases will be named after cricket fielding positions.

This needs Drupal 7, with features. The codebase adds on features and custom modules. I expect there will be a few commits over the next few weeks, to get all this working properly.

make sure to run 'rqcontenttypes' first to get the content types installed, then switch the rest on.


This is structured to allow future codebases, newer releases of Drupal, and other ports to other frameworks.

Docs:
this contains the core docs releated to getting started and everything related to the code, cucustom modules, features it takes to build and run this code. 

Drupal7: this contains all the custom modules, features module exports that are needed to be applied oyto any Drupal7 framework to get the  code running.


While we get things in place... a quick run down. If you cant wait to get up & running, ping me/ one of the RealQuestions Team at www.realquestions.net.au

It is important to note here, that currently it contains the political structure for the Australian goverment model. For usage in any other region, it will need to be changed appropriately. We at RealQuestions are willing to help with any efforts, for any willing teams from those regions to step forward.
